## Interval Scheduling
- **Concept:** Interval scheduling is a problem where we are given a set of jobs with their start and finish times.  
- **Goal:** To find the maximum subset of mutually compatible jobsâ€”meaning jobs that do not overlap.  
- **Key Idea:** A job j starts at s_j and finishes at f_j. Two jobs are **compatible** if their time intervals **do not overlap**.  
- **Example:** The given jobs (labeled as 'a' to 'h') are represented as horizontal bars on a timeline.  
- **Optimal Solution (OPT):** The selected subset of jobs is B, E, H, as they form the largest set of non-overlapping intervals.  
- **Observation:** The smallest job (C) is not in any optimal solution, and the job that starts first (A) is also not included.
